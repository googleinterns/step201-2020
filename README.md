# EasyLinks
EasyLinks is a project that helps people specifially college students to organize their frequently visited websites. Users can store their frequently used website urls as a short, easy-to-remember shortcut. Also, EasyLinks offers handy services for college students to navigate on campus and search for students or faulty member's contact info in the same institution.

## :one: Using EasyLinks
**To use a link, you can simply type in the link in the search bar or append it at the end of the EasyLinks URL.**

For example, say we want to use the shortcut `rmp` that is mapped to [rate-my-professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) website:
- Append to the end of the EasyLinks URL, like `https://easylinks-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/rmp`

- Type in directly in the search bar.

## :two: Create and Manage Your Own Links
**All links created will be shown and can be managed on the [management page](https://easylinks-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/manage.html).**

You can create and use two types of links:
| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| Public links | Created by one user but can be viewed and used by all users.|
| Private links| Created by one user and can be only be viewed and used by that user.       |

**Note:**
  1. To use private links, you need to login with your email first.
  2. `~next`, `~who`, `~where` are reserved shortcuts for our provided services. You may not create or change links starting from those. For more information, [see below](https://github.com/jiaxi312/hello-word/blob/master/README.md#three-calender-next).

## :three: Calender: `~next`
`~next` will show the upcoming events of the day on your Google calender. 

EasyLinks will help you to navigate to the event location and calculate a set off time.

Also, as most people are WFH, EasyLinks will also display the Hangout link if there is any.

### Usage: ###

Type `~next` directly in the search bar.

*OR* 

Append `~next` to the EasyLinks URL, like `https://easylinks-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/~next`.

### Note: ###
You need to authorize EasyLink to view your Google Calender.

## :four: People Search: `~who` ###
`~who` will assist you to search people in your school and send them emails.

All matching people and their associated email addresses will be displayed for user to choose from.

To use it, simply add the name you want to search to the shortcut. See example below.

### Usage: ### 
**The example below shows how to search people called Alice.**

Type `~who/Alice` in the search bar.

*OR*

Append `~who/Alice` to the EasyLinks URL, like `https://easylinks-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/~who/Alice`.

### Note: ###
For now, People Search is only avaliable for students at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). More is about to coming.

## :five: Navigation: `~where` ##
`~where` shortcut will search a place you type in.

If you are a college student, you can use abbreviation of your school buildings for searching!

To use it, simply add the destination name or abbrevation you want to search to the shortcut. See example below.

### Usage: ###
**The example below shows how to search the place with abbrevated name WAT (stands for Watson Hall).**

Type `~where/wat` in the search bar.

*OR*

Append `~where/wat` to the EasyLinks URL, like `https://easylinks-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/~where/wat`.

### Note: ###
For now, abbrevation search will only support building in [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). More will be added in future.
